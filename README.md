## Roman to Integer

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

**Symbol**       **Value**
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

*   `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
*   `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
*   `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "III"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** III = 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "LVIII"
**Output:** 58
**Explanation:** L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "MCMXCIV"
**Output:** 1994
**Explanation:** M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 15`
*   `s` contains only the characters `('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M')`.
*   It is **guaranteed** that `s` is a valid roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.

## Zigzag Conversion

The string `"PAYPALISHIRING"` is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)

P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R

And then read line by line: `"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"`

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:

string convert(string s, int numRows);

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
**Output:** "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
**Output:** "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
**Explanation:**
P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "A", numRows = 1
**Output:** "A"

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
*   `s` consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), `','` and `'.'`.
*   `1 <= numRows <= 1000`

## Palindrome Number

Given an integer `x`, return `true` _if_ `x` _is a_

_**palindrome**_

_, and_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** x = 121
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** x = -121
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** x = 10
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

**Constraints:**

*   `-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
